Lazy Overlay
============


This software is for SteamVR and overlays various masks in front of each eye for various vision experiments.

It is intended to be useful in exploring vision conditions such as Amblyopia, aka "Lazy Eye" by creating conditions that force the deficient eye to engage and "work harder".
